# Black-Jack-Project
This python Object-Oriented Program was my first project in my Java class this year. The program simulates and online version
of the card game Black Jack and shows examples of how to inherit classes and work with parent functions (change/modify). It is
a fun and successful online game and I hope ot add visual componenets in the future.
